        Ingredients

        <p>
            Dried Pasta... any work well<br>
            Water<br>
            Salt<br>

        Method
    </h3>
        <p>
            1) Boil your pasta adding salt to the water for later on.<br>
            2) While pasta is cooking grate your cheese/drain your tuna.<br>
            3) When the pasta is cooked add about half a tube of tomato puree, stirring well, to give you a passata consistency. Of course you can just use passata if you want, and drain the pasta instead.<br>
            4) Then, add the tuna if using any, stirring it in well. Leave for a minute to heat up the tuna. Add salt/pepper to taste.
            5) Serve into a bowl and sprinkle lots of cheese on top.<br> 
            Enjoy!<br>
            *This can be enjoyed as a simple tomato pasta, or with cheese or tuna, or both
