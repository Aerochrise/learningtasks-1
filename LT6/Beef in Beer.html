        Ingredients
    </h2>
        <p>
            500g of cheap beef pieces (stewing steak usually is cheap)<br>
            500 mls of real ale<br>
            4 large onions<br>
            2 fat cloves of garlic<br>
            tbsp of plain flour<br>
        </p>

        Method
    </h3>
        <p>
            1) Raw beef, roll it in the flour...fry 4-5 pieces at a time in a hot saucepan to seal...put to one side when all done<br>
            2) Cut the onions into quarters...fry in the same frying pan as the beef...to soak up the juices...<br>
            3) Towards the end of frying the onion (they should be nicely brown round the edges) throw in the smashed up cloves of garlic.<br>
            4) Transfer the beef, onions, garlic to a deep casserole dish. Stir in the remaining flour<br>
            5) Pour on the bottle of beer - really, it isn't going to be wasted!!!<br>
            6) Cover, and cook at 150 for about 2 and a half hours...will be gorgeous when it comes out, trust me...serve with mash<br>
