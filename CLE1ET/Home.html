            <h3>Corruption</h3>
            <p><b>Corruption</b> undermines confidence, undermines democracy, stifles economic development, and exacerbates inequality, poverty, social division, and the environmental disaster. We can only expose corruption and hold corrupt people accountable if we understand how corruption works and the mechanisms that support it.</p>
            
            <p><b>Corruption</b> can occur in a variety of settings, including business, government, the courts, the media, and civil society, as well as in a variety of sectors ranging from health and education to infrastructure and sports.</p>

            <p>Politicians, government officials, public servants, business persons, and members of the public can all be involved in corruption.</p>

            <p><b>Corruption</b> occurs in the shadows, often with the assistance of professional enablers such as bankers, lawyers, accountants, and real estate agents, as well as opaque financial systems and anonymous shell companies that enable corruption schemes to thrive and the corrupt to launder and hide their illicit wealth.</p>

            <p><b>Corruption</b> adapts to shifting events and environments. Changes in rules, legislation, and even technology might cause it to adapt.</p>
            
            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <h5>Corruption in the Philippines</h5>
            <img src ="Phcorrupt.jpg" alt="phimg">
            <p>The Philippines has a major corruption problem that dates back to the Spanish colonial period. According to GAN Integrity's Philippines Corruption Report, which was updated in May 2020, the Philippines is plagued by corruption and criminality in a variety of areas and industries. Corruption threats abound in the state's judicial system, police force, public services, land administration, and natural resource management. Graft, bribery, favoritism, nepotism, impunity, embezzlement, extortion, racketeering, fraud, tax evasion, lack of transparency, insufficient enforcement of laws and government policies, and a constant lack of support for human rights are all examples of corruption in the Philippines. In the Philippines, corruption is a major impediment to good administration.</p>
            <p>According to a survey of current literature, the Philippines has a significant scale and scope of corruption, ranging from minor bribery to grand corruption, patronage, and state control. To combat corruption, significant efforts have been made, including the establishment of legislative and institutional frameworks, as well as initiatives by civil society organizations and the media. Donor agencies are also actively involved in strengthening capacity in the Philippines to combat corruption. However, the effectiveness of these attempts is far from certain, and many analysts feel that structural barriers such as entrenched cronyism continue to sabotage anti-corruption efforts.</p>
