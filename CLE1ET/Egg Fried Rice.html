        Ingredients
    </h2>
        <p>
            Rice (as much as you fancy really!)<br>
            Half an onion (Or more, again if you fancy it)<br>
            A tin of sweetcorn<br>
            A few mushrooms<br>
            1-2 eggs<br>
        </p>
    <h3>
        Method
    </h3>
        <p>
            1) Start cooking the rice however you do, and put some oil in a frying pan.<br>
            2) Chop the onion into bits, any size really, doesnt matter particularly and throw into the frying pan.<br>
            3) Chop the mushrooms and add to the onions.<br>
            4) Once the rice is cooked, drain it off and add it into the frying pan. Tip the drained sweetcorn into the pan as well and stir it all up.<br>
            5) Break the eggs into the pan (OR beat them together in another bowl and tip into the frying pan) and stir the mixture up.<br>
            6) At this point, you need to keep stirring the mixture, keeping the eggs moving. Keep going until the eggs have cooked, should take about 5-8 minutes maybe?<br>
